# Models Overview

## Choosing a model

If you're unsure which model to use, we recommend starting with **Claude Sonnet 4.5**. It offers the best balance of intelligence, speed, and cost for most use cases, with exceptional performance in coding and agentic tasks.

All current Claude models support text and image input, text output, multilingual capabilities, and vision. Models are available via the Anthropic API, AWS Bedrock, and Google Vertex AI.

Once you've picked a model, [learn how to make your first API call](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/get-started).

**Notes:**

1. Aliases automatically point to the most recent model snapshot. When we release new model snapshots, we migrate aliases to point to the newest version of a model, typically within a week of the new release. While aliases are useful for experimentation, we recommend using specific model versions (e.g., `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`) in production applications to ensure consistent behavior.

2. See our [pricing page](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/about-claude/pricing) for complete pricing information including batch API discounts, prompt caching rates, extended thinking costs, and vision processing fees.

3. Claude Sonnet 4.5 supports a [1M token context window](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/context-windows#1m-token-context-window) when using the `context-1m-2025-08-07` beta header. [Long context pricing](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/about-claude/pricing#long-context-pricing) applies to requests exceeding 200K tokens.

4. **Reliable knowledge cutoff** indicates the date through which a model's knowledge is most extensive and reliable. **Training data cutoff** is the broader date range of training data used. For example, Claude Sonnet 4.5 was trained on publicly available information through July 2025, but its knowledge is most extensive and reliable through January 2025. For more information, see [Anthropic's Transparency Hub](https://www.anthropic.com/transparency).

Models with the same snapshot date (e.g., 20240620) are identical across all platforms and do not change. The snapshot date in the model name ensures consistency and allows developers to rely on stable performance across different environments.

Starting with **Claude Sonnet 4.5 and all future models**, AWS Bedrock and Google Vertex AI offer two endpoint types: **global endpoints** (dynamic routing for maximum availability) and **regional endpoints** (guaranteed data routing through specific geographic regions). For more information, see the [third-party platform pricing section](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/about-claude/pricing#third-party-platform-pricing).

### Legacy models

The following models are still available but we recommend migrating to current models for improved performance:

| **Training data cutoff** | Mar 2025 | Nov 2024 | Mar 2025 | Jul 2024 | Aug 2023 |

**Legacy model notes:**

1. Claude Sonnet 4 supports a [1M token context window](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/context-windows#1m-token-context-window) when using the `context-1m-2025-08-07` beta header. [Long context pricing](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/about-claude/pricing#long-context-pricing) applies to requests exceeding 200K tokens.

2. **Reliable knowledge cutoff** indicates the date through which a model's knowledge is most extensive and reliable. **Training data cutoff** is the broader date range of training data used.

3. Some Haiku models have a single training data cutoff date.

4. Include the beta header `output-128k-2025-02-19` in your API request to increase the maximum output token length to 128K tokens for Claude Sonnet 3.7. We strongly suggest using our [streaming Messages API](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/streaming) to avoid timeouts when generating longer outputs. See our guidance on [long requests](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/errors#long-requests) for more details.

## Prompt and output performance

Claude 4 models excel in:

- **Performance**: Top-tier results in reasoning, coding, multilingual tasks, long-context handling, honesty, and image processing. See the [Claude 4 blog post](http://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-4) for more information.

- **Engaging responses**: Claude models are ideal for applications that require rich, human-like interactions.
  - If you prefer more concise responses, you can adjust your prompts to guide the model toward the desired output length. Refer to our [prompt engineering guides](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering) for details.
  - For specific Claude 4 prompting best practices, see our [Claude 4 best practices guide](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/claude-4-best-practices).

- **Output quality**: When migrating from previous model generations to Claude 4, you may notice larger improvements in overall performance.

## Migrating to Claude 4.5

If you're currently using Claude 3 models, we recommend migrating to Claude 4.5 to take advantage of improved intelligence and enhanced capabilities. For detailed migration instructions, see [Migrating to Claude 4.5](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/migrating-to-claude-4).
